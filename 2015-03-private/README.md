This is small achivement written about 6,000 lines, build in 5 years ago.
Wrote for my limited purpose only, so that there are some pending bugs and problems.

1. Command response freeze while using several times.
2. H-Scrollbar behavior not implemented.
3. Resize behavior not completely.
4. Cannot use any built-in command except for 'cd'.
5. 'PATH' enviorment variable is fixed.
...

Placed only to show start point of updating design model.
(Old version is far to organized code, so that source code is not public, but put only design-model, snapshot, sample code and binary.)
In addition to, this implements include many behavior of shell, design model will be changed structure on linux depending 'bash' for its behavior.
